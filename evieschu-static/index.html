      <h2>All About Evie</h2>
      
      <p>Evie Schuckman (they/them) is an actor, singer, devising artist, and visual storyteller. They grew up in the swampy shrubbery of West Palm Beach, Florida, they come from a tight knit Chinese-Russian-Jewish-American family, and they've done this all their life.</p>
      
      <p>Their favorite color is purple, and their dog's name is Sunday. (short for Sunday in the Park with George.)</p>
      
      <p>They hold a BFA in Musical Theatre from Boston Conservatory, with an emphasis in devising and solo performance. Evie has appeared as an actor in regional theatre, national tours, TV, and commercial campaigns. They've performed on stages across the US - most recently as "Mrs. Hsu/Emery" in the national tour of Parable of the Sower, a "congregational opera" based on the 1993 Octavia Butler novel.</p>
      
      <p>Evie toured with Parable for two consecutive seasons before joining the closing company at New York City's Lincoln Center in 2023. Alongside a career in creating innovative and diverse musical theatre, their art activism work has been featured in publications such as The New York Times, The Boston Globe, and Breitbart News (a story they LOVE to tell over coffee).</p>
      
      <p>They're currently a resident acting company member at Mercury Store in Gowanus, BK, where they help develop new plays with visiting artists from across New York. They are a Breaking the Binary Theatre artist, and a member of Ring of Keys.</p>
      
      <p>When not onstage or in the rehearsal room, Evie is the HBIC (head businessperson in charge) of gubbins nyc--a sustainable clothing brand and styling service based out of their home studio.</p>
      
      <p>In every facet of their life, Evie is fascinated with the art of transformation.</p>
      
      <p>They live in Brooklyn, they are a double Leo with a Sag rising, you can find them on Instagram @evieschu --and in real life, on rooftops.</p>
